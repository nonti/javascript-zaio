/**
You are given two variables, a and b, and a single test case. Your task is to assign values to a and b so that the test case evaluates to true. You should use JavaScript's coercion system to achieve this without performing any explicit type conversions or using functions like parseInt, toString, etc.
1) You should not use any functions or explicit type conversion (e.g., parseInt, toString, etc.).
2) Modify the code and print the appropriate message based on the test case shown below.
3) You can use any JavaScript built-in data types (numbers, strings, booleans, etc.).
4) You can use any valid JavaScript operators and expressions to assign values to a and b.
*/

const a = "25";
const b = "25";

const testCase = a == b;

console.log(testCase);
